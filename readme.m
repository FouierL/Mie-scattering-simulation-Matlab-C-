% For first time users, please run test_MC.m
% 
% To run Monte Carlo simulation, only the main function need to be called.
% But if you are not familiar with the data struction of the inputs for MC,
% you can run InitializeInput to create a input data structure.
% 
% Main Function:
%     MC.m: Main program for Monte Carlo Simulation
% Supporting Functions:
%     InitializeInput.m: initialize the input data structure. 
%     MC_dll.dll: the DLL function which excutes most of the operations
%     MC_dll.h: the library file for MC_dll.dll
%     ProcessOutput.m: process the output data structure
% Also In this Folder:
%     inputdatafile_1.m: the sample input file
%     readme.m: this file
